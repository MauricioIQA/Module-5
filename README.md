# Module-5
PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analisys 
The purpose of this analysis is to help Pyber, a ride sharing company, to visualize key metrics of their operation like total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban) and issue some recommendations to the CEO.

## Results

We can clearly appreciate that, as expected, urban areas where we have higher concentrations of population are the cities that have the most rides and drivers, this is also noticeable in the average fare per ride, since we have a higher offer of drivers the costs tend to go down, and we can also think that the average distance in the urban cities is lower comparing it to rural or suburban areas. 
There’s an enormous difference in rural and urban in terms of demand and offer of drivers, that is also appreciated in the other columns.

## Summary

I would recommend the CEO:

  1.- Rural and suburban can be managed in the same way, we have a good proportion of offer and demand, basically I would advise to control the offer of possible driver to make it   profitable to drivers in those areas
  
  2.- Urban is another story, there’s surely more competitors in Urban areas, there is an excess of drivers hence the average fare per driver is pretty low, of course if they have   enough demand of rides they can manage to make more profit but even though there’s an important demand of rides is not enough for drivers to stay in Pyber and they might find     other services to have more demand. You should invest in marketing to gain more users 
  
  3.- I would advise a more aggressive strategy to gain more users in Urban areas, because there’s were the company is actually going to grow, maybe in suburban and urban areas yo   don’t have more users because there are not enough people that may use the service, but in Urban areas you need to have more rides for the drivers otherwise you might start       losing them and that can cause eventually a shortage of offer and then losing more clients. You have to balance the offer you have with the demand you can manage to obtain
